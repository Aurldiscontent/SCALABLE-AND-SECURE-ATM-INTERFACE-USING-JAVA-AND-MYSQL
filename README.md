# SCALABLE AND SECURE ATM INTERFACE USING JAVA AND MYSQL
The Scalable and Secure ATM Interface is a Bank Management System developed using Java technologies such as AWT, Swing, and JDBC, with MySQL as the database for efficient storage and management of banking data. This system is designed to provide a seamless, user-friendly, and secure interface for performing essential banking operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, mini statements, and PIN changes. The integration of JDBC with MySQL ensures real-time transaction processing and data consistency, enabling a smooth banking experience. The graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing and AWT enhances usability, making it accessible to users with minimal technical knowledge.

Security and scalability are key features of this system, ensuring the protection of sensitive banking data through authentication mechanisms and secure database connectivity. The system is designed to handle multiple user interactions efficiently, making it suitable for both small and large-scale banking environments. The use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java enhances modularity and maintainability, allowing future expansions or integrations with additional banking services. Overall, this ATM interface provides a robust, efficient, and secure banking solution while ensuring ease of use and reliable performance.
